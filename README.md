# Tic Tac Toe Game (C++)

## Overview
This project is a **console-based Tic Tac Toe game** implemented in **C++**.  
It allows two players to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game by taking turns on a 3×3 grid. The program validates user input, updates the game board after every move, and determines the game outcome (win or draw).

This project demonstrates **basic game logic, control flow, and array manipulation** in C++.


## Tech Stack
